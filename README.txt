== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do you generate the translations? =

Google translate is used in the backend to generate translated text.

= How good are the translations? =

The translations vary in quality between languages. For most of the widely spoken languages the translations are at least as good as a semi-fluent foreigner speaking the language at a B2 kind of level. There will be some gramatical errors and sometimes technical or slang words are not translated correctly or in context.

= Where can I find out more about WPTranslator? =

We have a website available at [Wordpress Translator](http://wptranslator.com/ "Wordpress Translator")

= What can I do about translation mistakes? =

Google is investing a lot of time and money into their translation service, it is constantly evolving and we expect the translations to improve over time. They are already excellent to be fair. There is a submission feature at [translate.google.com](http://translate.google.com/ "Google Translate") where you can submit recommended changes and mistakes for correction by the algorithm. These may or may not be implimented in a timely fashion however as it is dependant on Googles local translation team.

= What languages are included =

There are over a hundred languages which are supported including English, French, Spanish, Italian, Portugese, German, Chinese, Russian etc. There's a full list at [Wordpress Translation Languages](http://wptranslator.com/full-list-of-translation-languages-available/ "full list of wordpress translation languages")
